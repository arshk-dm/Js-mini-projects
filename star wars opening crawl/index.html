          It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden
          base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
          <br /><br>

          During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
          Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, and space station with
          enough power to destroy an entire planet. <br /><br>

          Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home
          aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her
          people and restore freedom to the galaxy
